👋 Hello, I’m @NadulaKadawedduwa, currently a Senior at University of Maryland, College Park pursuing a Bachelors in Computer Science. M.S in Machine Learning by 2025
👀 I mainly work with ML models and specialize in Computer Vision. See my repos for some previous research and writings.
💞️ Currently conducting graduate research in the Intelligent Sensing (Comptuer Vision) Lab at UMD. I hope to eventually publish my own papers instead of reading them for a change.
