👋 Hello, I’m @NadulaKadawedduwa, currently a first year Masters Student (CS) at University of Maryland, College Park with a Bachelors in Computer Science.

👀 I mainly work with ML models and specialize in Computer Vision. See my repos for some previous research and writings.

💞️ Currently conducting graduate research in the Intelligent Sensing (Comptuer Vision) Lab at UMD. I hope to eventually publish my own papers instead of reading them for a change.
